## **Zhijing Jin talk, take away**

-better casual reasoning for LLMs
-a causal framework for different NLP task
-interpretation


Hallucinations

Structure reasoning + API + LLM

Fact-checking


## **Project1: correlation =? causality**

we don't want interpret the past but to act towards the future
what causes what

causal graph types: 
dataset: corr2cause, it is about exploration of relation between correlation and causality

corr2cause

benchmark collection: prompt-> correlational statements--> LLM --> judgement of causality


future work:

1. causal discovery by LLM from data
2. causal metric for specific domain


## **Project2: commonsense causality--- cutting-edge reasoning**


causal question: the causal questions depending on the specific task, to better make decision on commonsense question in daily life
----formalize QA as causal questions and combine many factors by causal graph for decision making.

## **Project3: formulate Nlp task with causal framework**

personalization (with user information/background or not), i.e., implicit and explicit personalization

cultural role (adaptivity, discrimination) in causal reasoning of LLMs, whether llm provide a correct or wrong fact with 
the user culture background (indeed influenced by culture for most LLMs)

LLMs tailer responses for desesired IP and undesired IP, i.e., the response bias for requests from different ip address

causlality between culture background and response for LLMs. 
Is the users' ip address cause different responses? (why it happens), interpretation
response bias cause by culture background

causal discovery of category (people group divided with age or nationality) known by LLMs
counter-fact on category
